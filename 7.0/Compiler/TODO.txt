App:
    - check if target is casting an interuptable spell, if not then use stun rather than skill bash
    - dash / stampeeding road / swiftness potion button
	- healing potion button - only use potion if low health and in combat
	- dps potion button - only use potion if boss mode
    - don’t use drums if have exhaustion debuff

Lua:
    - optimize lua based on class spec
    - optimize lua to use specific events rather than everything in update
    - generate a separate lua file for each class and update in TOC
    - reduce memory usage and do a cpu profile
    - move frames into an array because running out of local variables
	- set frame strata so the frame is not obscured by low health screen tint
	- make functions in conversion.lua local 

Fixed:
    - only use TF if you will be able to do a finishing move before it dies (ie cp >= 4 and target.health >= 200k - (10k * (110 - playerlevel)))
    - take into account the target health and level and if in a group or solo to decide which finisher to use
    - check Omen Of Clarity proc 
    - use UnitPowerMax() in POW.lua specifically for energy, and update EnergyToMax below as berserk increases energy to 150 (remove hard coded 100 value)
    - use Life.lua for the player instead of packing it inside of POW.lua
    - ooc does not appear to be working
    - dont cast HT when stealth
    - move screen location because it is obscured in class hall
    - if in vehicle, the should disactivate
    - use predswift to get a bloodtalon before casting ashamane's frenzy
    - deploy to c:\program files
    - maim can be used with any number of cp's if solo
    - button to toggle berserk mode (just sets a frame color for a few seconds, so the app can use berserk as soon as it is the correct time
