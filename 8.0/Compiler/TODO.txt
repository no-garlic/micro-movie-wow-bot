Feral:
    1 - Get focusser addon again
    1 - Check focus target works
        - istrue(IsSpellInRange("Moonfire", "focus")) does not work for Moonfire as the spellId changes based on stance

Addons:
    3 - Update Teleport Cloak for my item id's that dont work with it
    3 - Update TrufiGCD to have a whitelist rather than a blacklist 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backlog:
    - Clean up the LogData system
    - Test and fix or remove the Cooldown Timers
    - Check if target is casting an interuptable spell, if not then use stun rather than skill bash / wild charge
    - Consider logging TTD prediction vs actual.
    - Rename abbreviated names to text names to make things understandable, and use => operator
    - Change the spec rules to a text file with lambda expressions as a behavior tree / table rather than a complex set of nested if statements

        - PM> Install-Package NReco.LambdaParser -Version 1.0.7
    - Print to console the abilities not the buttons
    - Add a monitor frame (ctrl-alt-m) to monitor all values
    - Show the next ability that will be cast on the monitor by executing the keypressed function
    - Use signal bits (or a new frame) to send back to the client when an ability is used (the spellId maybe), from combat events, and show it on a new panel (or the monitor panel)
    - Move some common things up one level, such as player health, talents, target info, focus info, signal bits, etc
    - Simplify the Classxx classes, move some of the code and data components to the base class
    - SpecOption text (MovieMaker.cs::m_Options.Text) can be removed
    - Investigate Postal:IsChatFrameActive() function for chat frame
    - Change background color of App based on status
    - Add a class icon, use the class name in the Binding field, or use the class color in App so we know what class is connected
    - Update icons in ShowClassSpec() in MovieMaker.cs or move them to the actual spec cs file location
    - The config element ForceFightingABoss could be a signal bit, as well as ForceNotFightingABoss could be added
    - Automate ClassHelper to add all of the registered classes
    - Change folder names in solution to match character class names
    - Add Signal scope to be within the addon, not global
    - Add TTD scope to be within the addon, not global
    - Write all globals into classhelper, not into each addon, and dont duplicate clamp & shift
    - make method names (case) consistent
    - write size to classhelper and to addons so it does not need to be passed
    - Optimize lua to use specific events rather than everything in update
	- Set frame strata so the frame is not obscured by low health screen tint
    - Automate generation of macros
    - Each of the frame types should have an update function in ClassHelper, then the individual frames just call it with a few args
    - Training dummies are not supported fully (eg focusTargetUpdate)

Chat Frame:
    function Postal:IsChatFrameActive(i)
	    local _, _, _, _, _, _, shown = FCF_GetChatWindowInfo(i);
	    local chatFrame = _G["ChatFrame"..i]
	    if chatFrame then
		    if shown or chatFrame.isDocked then
			    return true
		    end
	    end
	    return false
    end
